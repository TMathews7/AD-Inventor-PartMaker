Hello,

This file is not planned to be released publically or anything of the likes
I am simply learning to use the Autodesk Inventor API, and learning VB.net

The MarshHelper in my code is not mine, I am unsure where I found it otherwise I would link it here.

As of current here are the things I am planning to implement,

I am planning to implement the following parts
  C - Channel
  HSS - Circle
  HSS - Square
  Propeller 

The Propeller is on hold as I have spent almost 8 hours in total trying to either rotate a a sketch or to use the Circular Pattern tool to no avail,
I believe I might be able to do it using a for loop and some extremely complicated math but at the moment I am not willing to figure it out.

Beyond that I plan to convert all CM inputs to MM, and to add a checkbox that allows you to use imperial units rather than metric.
